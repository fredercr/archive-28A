# archive-28A
On April 28, 2021, Colombia experienced the largest social outbreak in its history. The protests took to the streets of the whole country, the search for a dignified life, education, employment, health, the young people faced the police. Many of them were assassinated.  this project arises from a podcast that collected the voices of the protesters called "file 28A"  Today we see with concern the judicial and police attack on those who protested in the streets, the imprisonments, attacks and persecutions are every day.  We believe it is necessary that blockchain and Daaps can help create encrypted and secure communication channels, which allow the population to organize against repression.  For this reason we propose the creation of a 3.0 an Daap website that allows generating alternative and safe means of communication, where protesters can communicate without expecting reprisals from the police.  We propose an interactive chat that allows to encrypt communications, send files, develop backup copies of videos, audios, photographs that serve as judicial evidence against police violence.
